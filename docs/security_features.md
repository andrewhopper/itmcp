# Enterprise Security Features

itmcp is designed with enterprise-grade security features to ensure secure operations in high-scale environments. This document outlines the key security components and best practices for implementation.

## Security Level: Enterprise

itmcp is built to meet enterprise security requirements with comprehensive protection mechanisms:

## Session Management

Robust session management protects against unauthorized access and session-based attacks:

### Features

- **Secure Session Creation**: Cryptographically secure session ID generation
- **Session Expiration**: Automatic timeout after configurable periods of inactivity
- **Concurrent Session Control**: Limits on simultaneous sessions per user
- **Session Validation**: Real-time validation of session integrity and authenticity
- **Session Regeneration**: Periodic regeneration of session IDs to prevent hijacking
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted session storage with access controls

### Implementation

Sessions are implemented using a multi-layered approach:
1. Session initiation with secure token generation
2. Regular validation checks during command execution
3. Automatic expiration based on timeout settings
4. Session context maintained for command execution continuity

### Configuration

Session behavior can be configured in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
session_management:
  timeout_minutes: 30
  max_inactive_time: 15
  max_sessions_per_user: 3
  token_refresh_interval: 10
  secure_storage_encryption: AES-256
```

## Audit Logging

Comprehensive audit logging for security monitoring and compliance:

### Features

- **Command Logging**: Records of all executed commands with timestamps
- **User Attribution**: Association of actions with specific users/sessions
- **Success/Failure Logging**: Records of command execution results
- **Access Logging**: Tracking of authentication and authorization events
- **Security Event Flagging**: Highlighting of potentially suspicious activities
- **Tamper-Evident Logs**: Mechanisms to detect log tampering

### Implementation

The audit logging system implements:
1. Structured log format with consistent metadata
2. Secure log storage with tamper detection
3. Log rotation and archiving for long-term retention
4. Integration capabilities with SIEM systems
5. Real-time monitoring for security events

### Configuration

Audit logging can be configured in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
audit_logging:
  enabled: true
  log_level: INFO
  log_format: "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
  log_file: "/var/log/itmcp/audit.log"
  log_rotation: true
  rotation_size_mb: 10
  retention_days: 90
  tamper_detection: true
  alert_on_suspicious: true
```

## Additional Security Features

### Access Control

- **Command Whitelisting**: Strict control over permitted commands
- **Directory Restrictions**: Limited access to specified directories
- **Host Restrictions**: Connection limitations to approved hosts

### Secure Communication

- **Encryption**: All data in transit protected with TLS 1.3
- **Certificate Validation**: Validation of server certificates
- **Secure Protocols**: Modern, secure communication protocols

### Threat Protection

- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: Sanitization of command inputs
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scanning of dependencies
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identification of unusual command patterns

## Security Best Practices

### Deployment Recommendations

1. **Isolated Environment**: Deploy in a segregated network or container
2. **Least Privilege**: Run with minimal required permissions
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and system packages updated
4. **Backup Strategy**: Implement regular backups of configuration and logs
5. **Monitoring**: Set up real-time monitoring of logs and events

### Operational Security

1. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review audit logs and access patterns
2. **Security Testing**: Schedule penetration testing and security assessments
3. **Incident Response**: Establish procedures for security incidents
4. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date security documentation
5. **User Training**: Ensure users understand security implications

## Compliance Considerations

itmcp can be configured to assist with compliance requirements for:

- **SOC 2**: Audit controls and security monitoring
- **GDPR**: Data protection and access controls
- **PCI DSS**: Secure handling of sensitive environments
- **HIPAA**: Protection of systems with sensitive information

*Note: While itmcp provides security features that can support compliance efforts, full compliance depends on proper configuration, deployment, and organizational policies.*
