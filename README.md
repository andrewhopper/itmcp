## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Desktop** with an active Claude Pro/Enterprise subscription
  - Download from: [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/download)
- **Python 3.10** or higher
- **Git**
- **uv** (required for package management)

# Windows Installation

1. Install Prerequisites:
   
   **Option A** - Using winget (if available on your system):
   ```powershell
   winget install python git
   ```

   **Option B** - Manual installation (recommended):
   - Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org)
   - Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)

2. Install uv:

   Open Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) as administrator and run:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

   If you encounter any issues, you may need to restart your terminal or computer for the changes to take effect.

3. Clone and set up the project:
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/andrewhopper/itmcp.git
   cd itmcp
   ```

   Then create a virtual environment. Try these commands in order until one works:
   ```cmd
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   If that doesn't work, try:
   ```cmd
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

   Then activate the environment:
   ```cmd
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```cmd
   uv pip install mcp
   pip install -e .
   ```

**Note**: If you installed Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org), you'll typically use `python`. If you installed via winget or from the Microsoft Store, you might need to use `python3`. Try both commands if one doesn't work.

### macOS Installation

1. Install Prerequisites:
   ```bash
   brew install python git uv
   ```

2. Clone and set up the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andrewhopper/itmcp.git
   cd itmcp
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install mcp
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Configuration

### Whitelist Configuration

itmcp uses a configuration system to restrict which hosts, directories, and commands can be executed. These configurations are stored in the `config.yaml` file in the project root directory.

Example configuration:

```yaml
# Allowed hosts configuration
allowed_hosts:
  - 192.168.0.1
  - localhost
  - 127.0.0.1
  - example.com

# Allowed directories configuration
allowed_directories:
  - /tmp
  - /var/log
  - /home/admin/logs

# Allowed remote commands configuration
allowed_remote_commands:
  - ls
  - cat
  - grep
  - head
  - tail
  - df
  - du
  - uname
```

If the `config.yaml` file is not found or specific settings are missing, the system will default to a minimal set of safe values:
- Allowed hosts: localhost, 127.0.0.1
- Allowed directories: /tmp
- Allowed remote commands: ls, cat

These restrictions ensure that:
1. SSH connections are only made to whitelisted hosts
2. File operations only access whitelisted directories
3. Remote commands are limited to a predefined set of safe operations

### Enterprise Security Features

itmcp implements enterprise-grade security features:

1. **Session Management**
   - Automatic session tracking and expiration
   - Protection against session hijacking
   - Secure session storage

2. **Audit Logging**
   - Comprehensive logging of all executed commands
   - User activity tracking
   - Security event monitoring
   - Log rotation and archiving

3. **Performance Targets**
   - Optimized for 200ms response times
   - Scalable to support 10,000+ concurrent users
   - Efficient resource management

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Locate the correct configuration directory - try these paths in order:

1. `%APPDATA%\Claude\` (typically `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\Claude\`)
2. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AnthropicClaude\` (typically `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\AnthropicClaude\`)

Create or edit `claude_desktop_config.json` in the correct directory:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "itmcp": {
      "command": "C:/path/to/cloned/itmcp/venv/Scripts/python.exe",
      "args": [
        "C:/path/to/cloned/itmcp/src/itmcp/executor.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "C:/path/to/cloned/itmcp/src"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Important Notes for Windows:

- Use forward slashes (`/`) in paths, not backslashes (`\`)
- Replace `[YourUsername]` with your actual Windows username
- File must be named exactly `claude_desktop_config.json`
- If both possible config locations exist, try each until successful

### macOS

Create or edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "itmcp": {
      "command": "/path/to/cloned/itmcp/venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/cloned/itmcp/src/itmcp/executor.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/cloned/itmcp/src"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Important Notes for macOS:

- Replace `[YourUsername]` with your actual username
- You can use `$HOME` instead of `/Users/[YourUsername]` if preferred
- File must be named exactly `claude_desktop_config.json`
- The `command` path should point to the Python interpreter inside your virtual environment (`venv/bin/python`), not the system Python

### After Configuration

1. Restart Claude Desktop completely (quit/exit, not just close the window).
2. Click the üîå icon to verify the server appears in the "Installed MCP Servers" list.
3. If the server doesn't appear, check Claude's logs:
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\Logs\mcp*.log` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AnthropicClaude\Logs\mcp*.log`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`

## Security Considerations

This server executes commands with your user privileges. **Take these precautions:**

- Use **only** in VMs or disposable development environments.
- **Never** use on production systems or machines with sensitive data.
- Consider implementing command restrictions if needed.
- Monitor system access and activity.
- Keep backups of important data.
- Review audit logs regularly to detect suspicious activity.
- Use session management features to limit exposure.

**Disclaimer**: The developers are not responsible for any damages or losses resulting from the use of this software. Use it at your own risk.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check logs:**
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\Logs\mcp*.log` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AnthropicClaude\Logs\mcp*.log`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`

2. **Verify installation:**
   - Ensure `uv` is properly installed and in your PATH.
   - Check that `mcp` package is installed: `pip show mcp`.
   - Verify Python version is 3.10 or higher.

3. **Configuration issues:**
   - Double-check all paths in `claude_desktop_config.json`.
   - Verify JSON syntax is valid.
   - Ensure proper path separators for your OS.
   - Confirm config file is in the correct location.

4. **Environment issues:**
   - Make sure `virtualenv` is activated if using one.
   - Verify `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly.
   - Check file permissions.

5. **Test server manually:**
   ```bash
   # First, make sure you're in the itmcp directory:
   cd /path/to/cloned/itmcp
   
   # For macOS:
   ./venv/bin/python src/itmcp/executor.py
   
   # For Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\python.exe src\itmcp\executor.py

   # The executor will appear to hang with no output - this is normal.
   # It's waiting for connections from Claude Desktop.
   # Use Ctrl+C to stop it.
   ```

6. **Connection issues:**
   - If you get "Could not connect to MCP server" errors, ensure you're using the virtual environment's Python interpreter in your config file.
   - For macOS: Use `/path/to/cloned/itmcp/venv/bin/python`
   - For Windows: Use `C:/path/to/cloned/itmcp/venv/Scripts/python.exe`

## Testing

After setup, try these commands in Claude Desktop:

```text
Can you run 'pwd' and tell me what directory we're in?
```

or

```text
Can you list the files in my home directory? Which of them are larger than 200 MB?
```
